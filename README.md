* 2 Tier & 3 Tier Embedded System
* Hardware
    * CPU 
        * PC/IP
        * GPRs
        * Flags
        * Stack Pointer (MSP & PSP)
    * Memory
        * Code 
        * Data
    * Peripherals
        * GPIO
        * On Board Peripherals

* Bare Metal System
* SP, SF, Stack
    * SP - Register inside CPU -> Pointing to the top of Stack.
    * Stack - Chunk of memory.
    * SF - Frame created on the stack when you call a function & Deleted when you return from the function.
* Frame Pointer - Points to the base of frame.
* How are arguments pass to the function ?
    * on the Stack
    * on the Register
